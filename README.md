Within the folders, you will find detailed documentation and a breakdown of the content I've studied each week.

Each week's folder presents the topics I covered, the depth of study undertaken, comprehensive details about the challenges addressed, and insights from my course progression.

The "Programming Basics" course equips students with the foundational programming competencies required for all technology majors at Software University.

This encompasses writing programming code at an entry level, familiarising with a development environment (IDE), employing variables, data structures, operators, and expressions, 
interfacing with the console (reading input data and outputting results), utilising conditional statements (if, elif, else) and using loops (for loop, while loop and nested loops).
